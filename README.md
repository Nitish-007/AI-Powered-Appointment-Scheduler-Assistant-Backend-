# AI-Powered Appointment Scheduler Assistant(Backend) 

The **AI-Powered Appointment Scheduler Assistant** is a backend system that processes **natural language appointment requests** and extracts **structured details** such as:  

- **Intent** ‚Üí book, cancel, reminder, or unrelated  
- **Entities** ‚Üí date, time, department (e.g., dentist, doctor)  
- **Normalization** ‚Üí standard ISO date/time with timezone  

It supports **raw text** as well as **files (PDF, DOCX, images)** with OCR.

## Architecture  

The API is designed as a **multi-step pipeline**, combining **AI models** with **rule-based guardrails** for robust performance.  

### Step 1: Input Handling  
- Accepts:  
  - **Raw text** via JSON body  
  - **Files** (PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPG) via upload  
- If image/PDF/DOCX ‚Üí OCR/Document parsing is applied.  

**Why this design?**  
- Real-world appointment requests often come from emails, scans, or chat messages.  
- Supporting multiple formats increases usability.  

**Alternative considered**: Restricting to text-only input (faster but less practical).  

---

### Step 2: Intent Classification  
- Uses **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** to classify requests into:  
  - `appointment_request`  
  - `cancellation`  
  - `reminder`  
  - `not_related`  

**Why Logistic Regression?**  
- Lightweight, fast to train, interpretable.  
- Works well with limited training data.  

**Alternatives**:  
- Deep learning classifiers (transformers, BERT) ‚Üí more accurate but heavy and slow for API latency requirements.  

---

### Step 3: Entity Extraction  
- Uses **[GLiNER](https://huggingface.co/urchade/gliner_small)** for extracting `date`, `time`, and `department`.  
- Rule-based fallback for **departments** (`dentist`, `doctor`, `cardiologist`, etc.).  
- Regex cleanup for **time expressions** (e.g., `3.00 pm ‚Üí 3:00 pm`).  

**Why GLiNER?**  
- General-purpose NER that works out of the box for multiple entity types.  
- Lightweight compared to large NER models.  

**Alternative**: spaCy NER ‚Äì accurate but requires custom training for domain-specific entities.  

---

### Step 4: Normalization  
- Uses `parsedatetime` + `pytz` to convert date/time phrases (`next Friday at 3pm`) ‚Üí standardized `YYYY-MM-DD` + `HH:MM`.  
- Applies **Asia/Kolkata** timezone.  
- Guardrails return `"needs_clarification"` if parsing fails.  

**Why parsedatetime?**  
- Flexible natural language date parsing.  
- Handles relative expressions (`tomorrow`, `next Monday`).  

**Alternative**: Duckling (Facebook) ‚Üí very powerful but requires extra runtime and setup.  

---

### Step 5: Multi-Appointment Handling  
- Splits text into multiple sentences (`and also`, `then`, `also`).  
- Extracts entities + normalizes each independently.  

**Why?**  
- Users often request multiple appointments in a single query.  

**Alternative**: Treat whole text as one ‚Üí simpler but fails when multiple bookings exist.  

---

### Step 6: Guardrails & Error Handling  
- Returns `"needs_clarification"` if:  
  - Missing/ambiguous **date/time/department**  
  - Parsing fails  
- Rejects unsupported file types (`400 Bad Request`).

##  API Usage  

## How the API Works  

The **Appointment NLP API** is built using **FastAPI** and served with **Uvicorn**.  
Here‚Äôs the flow from **input to response**:

---

### üîπ 1. User Input  
- The client (user or frontend) sends an HTTP `POST` request to `/process_appointment`.  
- Input can be:
  - **Text only** (JSON: `{"text": "Book a dentist appointment tomorrow at 3pm"}`)  
  - **Text + File** (multipart upload: text query + PDF/DOCX/Image)  

---

### üîπ 2. FastAPI Endpoint  
- FastAPI receives the request in `my_app.py`.  
- Example route:
  ```python
  @app.post("/process_appointment")
  async def process_appointment(text: str = Form(...), file: UploadFile = File(None)):
      ...

    Here:

        text = plain query string

        file = uploaded document or image

FastAPI automatically validates and parses inputs before they reach your function.

### 3. Processing Pipeline

Inside the endpoint, the request goes through:

    Preprocessing

        Extract text from file if provided (OCR for images, parser for PDF/DOCX).

        Combine with raw text input.

    Entity & Intent Extraction

        A model (e.g., GLiNER, spaCy, Duckling, or regex) extracts:

            Intent (book, cancel, reschedule, reminder)

            Entities (department, date, time, doctor)

    Normalization & Guardrails

        Dates are converted into ISO format (2025-10-05).

        Times normalized to 24-hour format (15:00).

        Extra checks ensure incomplete/invalid dates don‚Äôt break the pipeline.

    Response Construction

        JSON response is built:

        {
          "intent": "book",
          "entities": {
            "department": "dentist",
            "date": "2025-10-05",
            "time": "15:00"
          },
          "source": "text+file"
        }

### 4. FastAPI ‚Üí Uvicorn

    FastAPI itself is just the web framework.

    To actually serve the API, we run Uvicorn, an ASGI server:uvicorn my_app:app --reload

    Here:

        my_app ‚Üí Python file name (without .py)

        app ‚Üí FastAPI app instance inside that file

    Uvicorn handles:

        HTTP requests/responses

        Async event loop

        High-performance serving

### 5. Ngrok (Optional Public URL)

    Locally, your app runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

    With Ngrok, you expose it as a public API like:
